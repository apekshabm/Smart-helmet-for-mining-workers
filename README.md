# Smart-helmet-for-mining-workers

A safety-focused wearable IoT solution designed to protect miners from hazardous working conditions. This project integrates environmental monitoring sensors with an ESP32 microcontroller to detect dangerous gases, temperature variations, and emergency situations in real time.

# Why This Project?
Mining is one of the most hazardous industries. Workers are exposed to:
- Harmful gases (CO, methane, smoke)
- Unsafe temperature/humidity levels
- Limited visibility and delayed emergency response
This smart helmet system provides **real-time monitoring and alerting** to improve mine safety and prevent life-threatening incidents.  

## 🛠️ Features
✔️ Detects harmful gases like CO, methane, LPG and smoke  
✔️ Monitors temperature and humidity inside the mine  
✔️ Real-time wireless transmission using ESP32 Wi-Fi  
✔️ Emergency switch to alert safety officers  
✔️ Works with **Blynk IoT app** for real-time dashboard  
✔️ Expandable and cost-efficient system
